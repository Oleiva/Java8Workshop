Java 8 Workshop
==============

Meta: About the workshop
--------------------------
The workshop is an internal event for my coworkers. Target audience are experienced Java developers who are 
interested in the new features of Java 8.

The workshop is based on unit tests that have a lot of comments to explain what's going on. This way, 
everyone can go through the workshop alone and without help. Each unit test class covers one aspect of the new 
features of Java 8. Feel free to pick one and read through the file. I recommend to read the tests from top to 
bottom because they depend on each other. Yeah I know, that's not what unit tests are for. But I don't care. ;)
 
 **Attention: There are hideous unit tests that do weird things such as not terminating. Please don't run all unit 
 tests and expect them to be green.** 


TODO at Hackcamp Wolfsburg on 2015-02-07
----------
- together invent exercises for each chapter
- java8.org -> Cheatsheet
- main focus on Java 8. But also touch versions 1.5 to 1.8.
- review all new packages for new classes and add them here
- Parallel streams are supposed to be faster. However, several intelligent people suggested to never use it because 
of thread issues. Read into that!
- new JVM monitor
