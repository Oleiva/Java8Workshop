Java 8 Workshop
==============

Meta: About the workshop
--------------------------
The workshop is an internal event for my coworkers. Target audience are experienced Java developers who are 
interested in the new features of Java 8 (all updates included). Goals of the workshop are

- having a fair overview over the new Java 8 features
- having a set of code examples to use as templates
- having a better knowledge about what Java version brings which features - however focus of this course is Java 8!

The workshop is based on unit tests that have a lot of comments to explain what's going on. This way, 
everyone can go through the workshop alone and without help. Each unit test class covers one aspect of the new 
features of Java 8. Feel free to pick one and read through the file. I recommend to read the tests from top to 
bottom because they depend on each other. Yeah I know, that's not what unit tests are for. But I don't care. ;)
 
 **Attention: There are hideous unit tests that do weird things such as not terminating. Please don't run all unit 
 tests at once and expect them to be green.**
