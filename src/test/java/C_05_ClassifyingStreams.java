     intermediate vs terminal operations:
     - intermediate operation returns stream, for example filter(...), map(...), peek(...)
     - terminal operations return something else and are the end of a list of operations, for example count(), reduce(...)

    Workflow: Each intermediate operation generates a new stream that "knows" which operations to execute on which
    elements of the input-stream. However, these operations are executed when the terminal operation occurs, not
    before! Then, the elements of the backing data source are visited one after the other and each intermediate and the
    terminal operation is performed on each element.
    Let's say we have three intermediate operations and a stream of 5 elements. Then each of the 5 elements is visited
    after each other and with each visit, every one of the three operations is performed at the current element. This
    way, every element has to be visited only once. This workflow is also necessary for parallel streams.
