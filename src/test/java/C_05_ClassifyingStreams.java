        Workflow: Each intermediate operation generates a new stream that "knows" which operations to execute on which
        elements of the input-stream. However, these operations are executed when the terminal operation occurs, not
        before! Then, the elements of the backing data source are visited one after the other and each intermediate and the
        terminal operation is performed on each element. The operations are executed vertically, not horizontally.
        Let's say we have three intermediate operations and a stream of 5 elements. Then each of the 5 elements is visited
        after each other and with each visit, every one of the three operations is performed at the current element. This
        way, every element has to be visited only once. This workflow is also necessary for parallel streams.

    /*
    Stateless vs stateful operations

    Stateless operations just need the element to operate and don't need to know anything about the rest of the stream.
    Examples are filter, map.

    Stateful operations need information about the rest of the stream. limit(...) for example needs to count the visited
    elements in order to know when to cancel and return. distinct(...) removes duplicates and hence has to remember the
    visited elements.

    Stateless operations are fast and don't cause trouble when being called in parallel streams. Stateful operations
    however have to be treated differently and are much slower. The most expensive operation is sort(...) because
    it has to copy the whole stream in order to compare its elements.
