    - common pool: ForkJoinPool has new method commonPool() that returns a singleton instance of the ForkJoinPool.
      Used for parallel streams.
    - new ForkJoinTask besides existing RecursiveTask and RecursiveAction: CountedCompleter. All three classes
      are used for recursive programming. CountedCompleter builds a tree structure of java objects while traversing
      the recursion
    - better accumulators
