        Task 1:
        a) Create a stream with the names of the attendants of this course. Traverse the stream and print out
           the names.
        b) Create a parallel stream and do the same. Is the output different? Why?

        Task 2:
        Expand your code from task 1 and filter out every name containing the letter "e". How many elements does
        the stream have now?

        Task 3:
        See task 2 from chapter 1. Use streams to simplify the Test.
