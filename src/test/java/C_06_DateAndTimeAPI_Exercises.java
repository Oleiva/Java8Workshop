    // Repetition is a source of learning:
    // What is a stream?
    // If the backing list of a stream is altered, what will happen to the stream?
    // Which kinds of operations are there?
    // Given a parallel stream that is executed a number of times. What can we say with certainty about the order
    // of execution of the operations?
    // When do intermediate operations of streams get executed?
    // Is every single intermediate operation executed in every stream?
